# Innovations and Opportunities in Liberal Arts Computing Education

# **DRAFT**

This is a [SIGCSE 2021](https://sigcse2021.sigcse.org) affiliated event organized by members of the [SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/).

This event builds on priorities identified at our [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/), and the program committee invites submissions for the following sessions:

  * __Curricular Models:__ Descriptions of curricular innovations that support uniquely liberal arts approaches to computing.
  * __CS+X Courses:__ Descriptions of “CS+X” courses, outcomes, and best practices for CS+X in a liberal arts context.
  * __Recruiting:__ Models for mentoring, recruiting and hiring PhD candidates and postdocs into computer science positions at liberal arts institutions.

All submissions will be lightly screened by the program committee for suitability. All suitable submissions will be made available to the community through this site and all authors of accepted submissions will receive an invitation to participate in the synchronous event and to optionally submit a video presentation.  In addition, the program committee will extend invitations to the authors of select submissions to participate in a panel discussion that will begin each synchronous session.

A template for submission or description of requested information is provided for each session, as well as a contact for questions or email submissions. All submissions may be made through email or GitHub pull request following the process described in the section below. Submissions to multiple sessions are welcome.

Apart from required SIGCSE TS registration there is no cost to participants. However, all participants must respond to the Call for Participation in one of the four forms described below.  We anticipate being able to invite everyone who expresses interest. However, in the unlikely event that our venue cannot accommodate everyone, attendees will be selected giving first priority to those contributing to one of the three sessions and then reviewing attendance applications to achieve representation from a broad range of institutions. All interested faculty and students are welcome.

## Important Dates:

- January 11, 2021 - Submissions Due
- January 25, 2021 - Notifications of acceptances, breakout topics and lead panelist invitations.
- Monday March 8 and Tuesday March 9 - SIGCSE Affiliated Event
  - **NEED_TO_ADD_TIMES_OF_DAY_HERE**

## Call for Participation:

The program committee invites four types of submissions for the pre-symposium event. Submission of one of the four types is required for participation in the event.  Participants are welcome to make multiple submissions.

1. __Curricular Model Submissions:​__ A brief (approximately 2-page) description of the curricular model of your liberal arts computing program.

    Please see the [Curriculum Submission Template](curricula/CurriculumModelTemplate.md) and the samples ([Dickinson College](curricula/dickinson/index.md), [Whitman College](curricula/whitman/index.md)).  Submissions describing models that are particularly innovative, or that leverage particular opportunities and/or challenges presented by the liberal arts context, and/or show potential for broadening participation in computing are encouraged.

    Given the COVID-19 disruption of our 2020 event, the committee welcomes updated resubmissions of curricular innovations from the 2020 event.

    * Contact: Jim Teresco <jteresco@siena.edu>
    * Template: [Curriculum Submission Template](curricula/CurriculumModelTemplate.md)

1. __CS+X Course Submissions:__
