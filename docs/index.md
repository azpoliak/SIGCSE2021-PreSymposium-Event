# Innovations and Opportunities in Liberal Arts Computing Education

A pre-symposium event at [SIGCSE 2021](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org) organized by members of the SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges.

This event builds on priorities identified at our [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/), and will cover three major topics. We will again discuss uniquely liberal arts approaches to computing curricula through presentation of selected curricula. We will explore models and best practices for “CS+X” courses, considering what the outcomes should be for such courses in order to take both disciplines into balanced consideration. We will consider models for mentoring, recruiting and hiring PhD candidates and postdocs into computer science positions at liberal arts institutions.
